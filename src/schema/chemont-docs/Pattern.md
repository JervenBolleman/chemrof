## Children

 * [AtomOccurrence](AtomOccurrence.md) - An occurrence of an atom in the context of a particular molecule. For example, one of two occurrences of oxygen in nitrate
 * [AtomicBond](AtomicBond.md) - A connection between two atoms. Note this is the reified form of 'atomically connected to'. 
 * [ChemicalEntity](ChemicalEntity.md) - An entity that can be described using using chemical properties.
 * [Stereocenter](Stereocenter.md) - a particular instance of a stereogenic element that is geometrically a point, bearing different substituents, such that interchanging any two substituents leads to a stereoisomer
