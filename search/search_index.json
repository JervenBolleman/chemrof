This is a 2D structure where bars and hyphens are used to indicate linkages, and monosaccharides are specified in the following order, separated by hyphens: anomer - configuration symbol - monosaccharide abbreviation. glycoct condensed - This is a multiline format used by GlycomeDB, among others, and uses a graph notation to represent glycans, similar to KCF. Monosaccharides are specified more strictly to be able to map the monosaccharides between different representations. Substituents, such as N-acetyl, are specified as separate nodes from their basetypes and are linked together in the edge section. If newlines are removed, this format can be made linear. glycominds linearcode representation - A linear notation proposed by GlycoMinds, Ltd., where monosaccharides are indicated by a one- or two-letter code, linkages are indicated by \u201ca\u201d or \u201cb\u201d for anomers and a single number for the carbon number linkage on the reducing end, and branches are indicated by parentheses. This format is the most compact among existing formats, and several databases use a modified form of this format to accommodate additional codes and varying carbohydrate structures (such as ambiguous structures). kegg chemical function representation - A multiline format used by the KEGG GLYCAN database and represents glycans as graphs. Monosaccharides are represented as nodes, and glycosidic linkages are represented as edges. Each node is given a unique number, and x- and y- coordinates are specified such that the glycan structure can be drawn on a 2D plane. Edge information uses the node numbers to specify anomeric and carbon number information. Monosaccharide names are specified as text, and no particular rules are specified to represent these names. linucs representation - A unique linear notation proposed and used by GLYCOSCIENCES.de, with the reducing end specified on the left. Monosaccharides, written according to CarbBank rules, are surrounded by square brackets and anomers, and stereochemistry is specified and separated by hyphens. Glycosidic linkages are also surrounded by hyphens, and carbon numbers of the linkages are separated by the plus sign. Branches are indicated by curly brackets. wurcs representation chemical formula - A generic grouping for miolecular formulae and empirical formulae curly smiles string - CurlySMILES is a chemical line notation which extends SMILES with annotations for storage, retrieval and modeling of interlinked, coordinated, assembled and adsorbed molecules in supramolecular structures and nanodevices. https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1758-2946-3-1 empirical formula - A chemical formula where numbers denote relative proportion of atoms.

This is a 2D structure where bars and hyphens are used to indicate linkages, and monosaccharides are specified in the following order, separated by hyphens: anomer - configuration symbol - monosaccharide abbreviation. glycoct condensed - This is a multiline format used by GlycomeDB, among others, and uses a graph notation to represent glycans, similar to KCF. Monosaccharides are specified more strictly to be able to map the monosaccharides between different representations. Substituents, such as N-acetyl, are specified as separate nodes from their basetypes and are linked together in the edge section. If newlines are removed, this format can be made linear. glycominds linearcode representation - A linear notation proposed by GlycoMinds, Ltd., where monosaccharides are indicated by a one- or two-letter code, linkages are indicated by \u201ca\u201d or \u201cb\u201d for anomers and a single number for the carbon number linkage on the reducing end, and branches are indicated by parentheses. This format is the most compact among existing formats, and several databases use a modified form of this format to accommodate additional codes and varying carbohydrate structures (such as ambiguous structures). kegg chemical function representation - A multiline format used by the KEGG GLYCAN database and represents glycans as graphs. Monosaccharides are represented as nodes, and glycosidic linkages are represented as edges. Each node is given a unique number, and x- and y- coordinates are specified such that the glycan structure can be drawn on a 2D plane. Edge information uses the node numbers to specify anomeric and carbon number information. Monosaccharide names are specified as text, and no particular rules are specified to represent these names. linucs representation - A unique linear notation proposed and used by GLYCOSCIENCES.de, with the reducing end specified on the left. Monosaccharides, written according to CarbBank rules, are surrounded by square brackets and anomers, and stereochemistry is specified and separated by hyphens. Glycosidic linkages are also surrounded by hyphens, and carbon numbers of the linkages are separated by the plus sign. Branches are indicated by curly brackets. wurcs representation chemical formula - A generic grouping for miolecular formulae and empirical formulae curly smiles string - CurlySMILES is a chemical line notation which extends SMILES with annotations for storage, retrieval and modeling of interlinked, coordinated, assembled and adsorbed molecules in supramolecular structures and nanodevices. https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1758-2946-3-1 empirical formula - A chemical formula where numbers denote relative proportion of atoms.

However, we also include a partial (currently very partial) set of entries in the database, ETL-ed from different sources. The database can be found in the database section ETL The ETL is largely driven by SPARQL CONSTRUCT queries. See the sparql folder and the Makefile. Note so far we have only ETL'd a very small set of datatypes for proof of principles: ChemicalElement Isotope MonoatomicIon Identifiers Rather than using incremental IDs as in OBO, we aim to use InChi strings as identifiers for almost all ChemicalEntity classes (except for the Atom branch). This facilitates integration between different sources - e.g. whether we ingest from chembl, pubchem, chebi, or wikidata. For the Atom branch, we use the standard symbols and nomenclature, e.g. Cu/2- For the ChemicalGrouping branch, there is no appropriate InChi, since these group chemical entities via abstraction. Here we use CHEBI IDs. Database file organization The database is organized according to the schema. We will provide the following formats: RDF/Turtle ( .ttl ) JSON-LD (`.jsonld) CSVs (todo) YAML (todo) SQL dumps (todo) Depending on the serialization, the data may be available in different files, one file per class/table in the schema. For example: ChemicalElement.ttl from WikiData Example the file ChemicalElement.ttl is derived from Wikidata and includes instances such as: chem:MonoatomicIon/Mn a chem:ChemicalElement ; rdfs:label \"manganese\"@en ; chem:symbol \"Mn\" ; chem:atomic_number 25.0 . This is referenced in instances in the file MonoatomicIon.ttl is derived from CHEBI, e.g: chem:MonoatomicIon/Mn/+4 rdf:type chem:MonoatomicIon ; rdfs:label \"manganese(4+)\" ; chem:chebi_iri CHEBI:25158 ; chem:charge 4 ; chem:has_element chem:Mn ; chem:inchi_string \"InChI=1S/Mn/q+4\"^^xsd:string . Similarly the file Isotope.ttl references the elements: chem:MonoatomicIon/Mn a chem:Isotope ; rdfs:label \"manganese-46m\"@en ; chem:neutron_number 21.0 ; chem:has_element <https://w3id.org/chemschema/ChemicalElement/Mn> . Merged Database We also provide a file all-merged.owl that contains both the schema (as owl classes) and data (as instances).

The idea here is to provide a schema in which the instances are classes in a chemical ontology. The schema could be thought of as an ontology of metaclasses, but care must be taken here due to mixing of different metamodel formalisms (this schema is closed-world and thus not well represented in OWL). The schema language used here is linkml , which provides powerful modeling framework that incorporates aspects of UML, ShEx, and OWL, and is semantic-web ready. The goal is to create instances of these schema classes (e.g. carbon-14) which would be OWL classes, auto-populated with standardized names and logical axioms.

A secondary objective is to be able to generate an ontology from the datamodel, and to use this to help advance the development of CHEBI. OWL generation See Makefile.etl for specific details. The basic idea is to transform the turtle instance data (where for example carbon is an instance of the ChemicalElement class, and carbon-12 is an instance of the sibling Isotope class) into classes, and to use reasoning to classify. Currently this is done via SPARQL construct (see owlgen folder but later this will be done by generating equivalence axioms from compound keys in the database. Example Mn(+4) is represented in the database as an individual of type MonoatomicIon chem:MonoatomicIon/Mn/+4 rdf:type chem:MonoatomicIon ; rdfs:label \"manganese(4+)\" ; ns1:chebi_iri CHEBI:25158 ; ns1:charge 4 ; ns1:has_element chem:Mn ; ns1:inchi_string \"InChI=1S/Mn/q+4\"^^xsd:string .

This will autoclassify to \"manganese ion\" etc here is an example of the atom hierarchy in protege, showing automatic classification: Two-level representation One thing that may seem unintuitive is that instances at the LinkML level are classes at the OBO level.
