There are deep problems with classification of atoms and molecular entities in CHEBI. These problems arise from a basic confusion about classes and metaclasses. Sources like IUPAC represent chemical species , instances of which are chemical elements , NOT instances in the OBO sense. This fundamental confusion means CHEBI does not work for OBO. The idea here is to provide a schema in which the instances are classes in a chemical ontology. The schema could be thought of as an ontology of metaclasses, but care must be taken here due to mixing of different metamodel formalisms (this schema is closed-world and thus not well represented in OWL). The schema language used here is biolinkml , which provides powerful modeling framework that incorporates aspects of UML, ShEx, and OWL, and is semantic-web ready. The goal is to create instances of these schema classes (e.g. carbon-14) which would be OWL classes, auto-populated with standardized names and logical axioms.
