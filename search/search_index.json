This is a 2D structure where bars and hyphens are used to indicate linkages, and monosaccharides are specified in the following order, separated by hyphens: anomer - configuration symbol - monosaccharide abbreviation. glycoct condensed - This is a multiline format used by GlycomeDB, among others, and uses a graph notation to represent glycans, similar to KCF. Monosaccharides are specified more strictly to be able to map the monosaccharides between different representations. Substituents, such as N-acetyl, are specified as separate nodes from their basetypes and are linked together in the edge section. If newlines are removed, this format can be made linear. glycominds linearcode representation - A linear notation proposed by GlycoMinds, Ltd., where monosaccharides are indicated by a one- or two-letter code, linkages are indicated by \u201ca\u201d or \u201cb\u201d for anomers and a single number for the carbon number linkage on the reducing end, and branches are indicated by parentheses. This format is the most compact among existing formats, and several databases use a modified form of this format to accommodate additional codes and varying carbohydrate structures (such as ambiguous structures). kegg chemical function representation - A multiline format used by the KEGG GLYCAN database and represents glycans as graphs. Monosaccharides are represented as nodes, and glycosidic linkages are represented as edges. Each node is given a unique number, and x- and y- coordinates are specified such that the glycan structure can be drawn on a 2D plane. Edge information uses the node numbers to specify anomeric and carbon number information. Monosaccharide names are specified as text, and no particular rules are specified to represent these names. linucs representation - A unique linear notation proposed and used by GLYCOSCIENCES.de, with the reducing end specified on the left. Monosaccharides, written according to CarbBank rules, are surrounded by square brackets and anomers, and stereochemistry is specified and separated by hyphens. Glycosidic linkages are also surrounded by hyphens, and carbon numbers of the linkages are separated by the plus sign. Branches are indicated by curly brackets. chemical formula - A generic grouping for miolecular formulae and empirical formulae curly smiles string - CurlySMILES is a chemical line notation which extends SMILES with annotations for storage, retrieval and modeling of interlinked, coordinated, assembled and adsorbed molecules in supramolecular structures and nanodevices. https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1758-2946-3-1 empirical formula - A chemical formula where numbers denote relative proportion of atoms.

This is a 2D structure where bars and hyphens are used to indicate linkages, and monosaccharides are specified in the following order, separated by hyphens: anomer - configuration symbol - monosaccharide abbreviation. glycoct condensed - This is a multiline format used by GlycomeDB, among others, and uses a graph notation to represent glycans, similar to KCF. Monosaccharides are specified more strictly to be able to map the monosaccharides between different representations. Substituents, such as N-acetyl, are specified as separate nodes from their basetypes and are linked together in the edge section. If newlines are removed, this format can be made linear. glycominds linearcode representation - A linear notation proposed by GlycoMinds, Ltd., where monosaccharides are indicated by a one- or two-letter code, linkages are indicated by \u201ca\u201d or \u201cb\u201d for anomers and a single number for the carbon number linkage on the reducing end, and branches are indicated by parentheses. This format is the most compact among existing formats, and several databases use a modified form of this format to accommodate additional codes and varying carbohydrate structures (such as ambiguous structures). kegg chemical function representation - A multiline format used by the KEGG GLYCAN database and represents glycans as graphs. Monosaccharides are represented as nodes, and glycosidic linkages are represented as edges. Each node is given a unique number, and x- and y- coordinates are specified such that the glycan structure can be drawn on a 2D plane. Edge information uses the node numbers to specify anomeric and carbon number information. Monosaccharide names are specified as text, and no particular rules are specified to represent these names. linucs representation - A unique linear notation proposed and used by GLYCOSCIENCES.de, with the reducing end specified on the left. Monosaccharides, written according to CarbBank rules, are surrounded by square brackets and anomers, and stereochemistry is specified and separated by hyphens. Glycosidic linkages are also surrounded by hyphens, and carbon numbers of the linkages are separated by the plus sign. Branches are indicated by curly brackets. chemical formula - A generic grouping for miolecular formulae and empirical formulae curly smiles string - CurlySMILES is a chemical line notation which extends SMILES with annotations for storage, retrieval and modeling of interlinked, coordinated, assembled and adsorbed molecules in supramolecular structures and nanodevices. https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1758-2946-3-1 empirical formula - A chemical formula where numbers denote relative proportion of atoms.

E.g. C6H12O6 for glucose smarts string reaction\u279esmarts string smiles string - A string encoding of a molecular graph, no chiral or isotopic information. There are usually a large number of valid SMILES which represent a given structure. For example, CCO, OCC and C(O)C all specify the structure of ethanol. canonical smiles string - A deterministic SMILES string. Note there is no unique system for canonical smiles strings extended smiles string isomeric smiles string - A SMILES string that distinguishes between isomeric forms. E.g. [13C] for carbon-13 has minchi representation - Proposed new Mixtures InChI has sequence representation amino acid sequence interval\u279ehas sequence representation nucleotide sequence interval\u279ehas sequence representation - By convention the sequence string is always the DNA sequence.

Example: CH3O/c1-2/h1H3/q-1 inchi atom connections sublayer - The atoms in the chemical formula (except for hydrogens) are numbered in sequence; this sublayer describes which atoms are connected by bonds to which other ones. polyatomic entity\u279einchi atom connections sublayer inchi chemical sublayer - the main chemical formula chemical entity\u279einchi chemical sublayer inchi hydrogen connections sublayer - Describes how many hydrogen atoms are connected to each of the other atoms. inchi tetrahedral stereochemical sublayer inchi version string standard inchi object\u279einchi version string name - name of chemical entity.

There are deep problems with classification of atoms and molecular entities in CHEBI. These problems arise from a basic confusion about classes and metaclasses. Sources like IUPAC represent chemical species , instances of which are chemical elements , NOT instances in the OBO sense. This fundamental confusion means CHEBI does not work for OBO. The idea here is to provide a schema in which the instances are classes in a chemical ontology. The schema could be thought of as an ontology of metaclasses, but care must be taken here due to mixing of different metamodel formalisms (this schema is closed-world and thus not well represented in OWL). The schema language used here is linkml , which provides powerful modeling framework that incorporates aspects of UML, ShEx, and OWL, and is semantic-web ready. The goal is to create instances of these schema classes (e.g. carbon-14) which would be OWL classes, auto-populated with standardized names and logical axioms.
